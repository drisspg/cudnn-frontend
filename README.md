# cuDNN FrontEnd(FE) API

## Introduction
The cuDNN FrontEnd(FE) API is a C++ header-only library that wraps the [cuDNN C backend API](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/api/index.html#cudnn-backend-api). Both the FE and backend APIs are entry points to the same set of functionality that is commonly referred to as the "[graph API](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/developer-guide/index.html#op-fusion)".

While there are two entry points to the graph API (i.e. backend and frontend), it is expected that most users will use the FE API. Reasons being:

- FE API is less verbose without loss of control. All functionality accessible through the backend API is also accessible through the FE API.
- FE API adds functionality on top of the backend API, like errata filters and autotuning.

Also, for those using backend API, FE API source and samples can serve as reference implementation.

FE v1.0 API extends the groundwork of earlier versions and introduces a new set of APIs to further simplify the workflow. In FE v1.0 API, users can describe multiple operations that form subgraph through a persistent cudnn_frontend::graph::Graph object. Unlike the FE v0.x API, users dont need to worry about specifying shapes and sizes of the intermediate virtual tensors. For detailed information of FE v1.0 API, see README.FE.v1.0.md. 

Additionally, FE v1.0 API provides python bindings to all API through pybind11. It is recommended that new users of cuDNN start with the frontend v1.0 API. See `samples/cpp` and `samples/python` for more details on its usage.

## Usage
In order to include the entire library, include the cudnn_frontend header file `include/cudnn_frontend.h` into your compilation unit.

## Build:

### Dependencies
With the release of v1.0, we are bumping up the minimum supported cudnn version to 8.5.0

cuda can be downloaded from the [nvidia dev-zone](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

cudnn can be installed from 
    - [nvidia dev-zone] (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
    - [pypi wheels] (https://pypi.org/project/nvidia-cudnn-cu12/)

Minimum python version needed 3.6
The python binding compilation requires development package which can be installed by running `apt-get install python-dev`.

To run the python samples, additionally, you will need the following python packages
- pytest
- pytorch-cuda=12.1 (or pytorch-cuda=11.8)
- torchvision
- torchaudio
- pytorch


### C++ API

C++ API is header only library. The following compilation steps are only required for building the samples and python bindings.

The CMakeLists.txt can be used reference to include the cudnn_frontend in your project.

Provide CUDA according to: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindCUDAToolkit.html  

CUDNN_PATH has the cudnn installation:
- Headers are in CUDNN_PATH/include.
- Libraries are in CUDNN_PATH/lib or CUDNN_PATH/lib64 or CUDNN_PATH/lib/x64.

From project Root,

```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DCUDNN_PATH=/path/to/cudnn -DCUDAToolkit_ROOT=/path/to/cuda  ../
cmake --build . -j16
bin/samples
```

Skip building samples by providing `CUDNN_FRONTEND_BUILD_SAMPLES=OFF` as cmake parameter.  
Skip building python bindings by providing `CUDNN_FRONTEND_BUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF` as cmake parameter.

In case, you have a stale cmake cache and want to update the cudnn/cuda paths, please delete the cmake cache (or build directory and redo the above steps).

### Python API
Install FE python API by running: 
pip install git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/cudnn-frontend.git

Incase of custom installation of CUDA and CUDNN, the default path can be overriden by:

`CUDAToolkit_ROOT=/path/to/cuda CUDNN_PATH=/path/to/cudnn pip install /path/to/cudnn_frontend`.

To provide a custom CUDA, export environment variable: `CUDAToolkit_ROOT`.  
To provide a custom CUDNN, export environment variable: `CUDNN_PATH`.

```
    pytest samples/python
```

NOTE: Only v1.0 API is exposed via python bindings.

## Debugging
For initial debugging, we recommend turning on the cudnn FE logging and checking for warnings and errors.
cuDNN Frontend API logging records execution flow through cuDNN frontend API. This functionality is disabled by default, and can be enabled through methods described in this section.

### Method 1: Using Environment Variables:
| Environment variables                             | CUDNN_FRONTEND_LOG_INFO=0 | CUDNN_FRONTEND_LOG_INFO=1 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -----------               |
| CUDNN_FRONTEND_LOG_FILE not set                   | No Logging                | No Logging                |
| CUDNN_FRONTEND_LOG_FILE set to stdout or stderr   | No Logging                | Logging to cout or cerr   |
| CUDNN_FRONTEND_LOG_FILE set to filename.txt       | No Logging                | Logging to the filename   |

### Method 2: Using API calls:
Calling `cudnn_frontend::isLoggingEnabled() = true|false` has same effect of setting the environment variable.
Calling `cudnn_frontend::getStream() = stream_name` can be used to assign the output stream directly.

For further debugging, please turn on the cudnn backend logs described here https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/developer-guide/index.html#api-logging
